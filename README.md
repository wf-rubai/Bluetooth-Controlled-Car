# Arduino Bluetooth-Controlled Car

This project creates a two-motor car controlled by an Arduino Uno and a Bluetooth app. The car uses the L298N motor driver for controlling motor speed and direction.

## **Wiring Diagram**

| L298N Pin  | Arduino Pin | Purpose                  |
|------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **ENA**    | Always HIGH | Enable Motor A           |
| **IN1**    | Pin 5       | Motor A - Forward        |
| **IN2**    | Pin 6       | Motor A - Backward       |
| **IN3**    | Pin 9       | Motor B - Forward        |
| **IN4**    | Pin 10      | Motor B - Backward       |
| **ENB**    | Always HIGH | Enable Motor B           |
| **GND**    | Arduino GND | Shared ground            |
| **VCC**    | External 12V| Motor power              |
| **5V**     | Arduino 5V  | Optional Arduino power   |

## **Commands**

| Command | Action                  |
|---------|-------------------------|
| `F`     | Move Forward            |
| `B`     | Move Backward           |
| `L`     | Turn Left               |
| `R`     | Turn Right              |
| `S`     | Stop                    |
| `0-9`   | Set Speed (0 = stop, 9 = full speed) |

## **Steps to Build**

1. Connect the **L298N motor driver** to the motors, Arduino, and power supply as described in the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the modified code (`.ino` file) to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. Open the serial monitor (baud rate: `9600`) or pair the Arduino's Bluetooth module with your smartphone using a compatible app.
4. Send commands via the app or serial monitor to control the car.
   - Example: Sending `F` will make the car move forward, and sending `5` will set the speed to ~50%.

## **Notes**

- **Enable Pins (ENA and ENB):**
  - These pins must be set to HIGH. If your L298N module has jumpers, leave them in place for full power. Otherwise, connect to a PWM pin for dynamic speed control.
  
- **Power Supply**:
  - Use an external 12V power source for the motors to avoid overloading the Arduino.
  - Ensure that Arduino and L298N share a common ground.

- **Bluetooth Module**:
  - Pair your Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05) with the mobile app, and connect its TX/RX pins to the Arduino RX/TX.

## **Additional Information**

- The `map()` function maps commands from `0-9` to PWM values (`0-255`) for smooth speed control.
- Adjust motor speed using the `setMotors()` function, which manages speed and direction logic.
- Test your connections before applying a high voltage to ensure proper wiring.
